        <P>
          Transcending a multitude of genres, Thug Shells is happiest throwing
          down over breakbeats and drum and bass. However, she has been known to
          rock over ANY music - maneuvering through the soundwaves as only a
          freestylinâ€™ ferret could. Usually teaming up with her go-to
          babe-a-liscious DJ K-Stylez - these two ladies are like nothing you've
          ever MC-seen before.
