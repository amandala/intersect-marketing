          Behind the decks, their live performance is high energy and
          interactive; engaging the audience through wild movement and ecstatic
          drive. Known for bringing the deep and heavy bass, their selection of
          trap, psytrap, neurohop, and glitchy bass music in addition to live
          guitar and synth work is sure to get your booty movinâ€™ in the most
          obscene and obscure means possible.
